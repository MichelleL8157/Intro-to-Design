    First, I made the html code, the h1, 3 paragraphs, and image with its source.
    Then I made the css document to separate what happens when the resolution
    is less than 600px and when it's more than 600px. The sizes of the assests
    of the page, including the font and image sizes, makes the same webpage look
    different.
